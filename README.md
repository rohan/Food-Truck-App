# Food-Truck-App

## Changes 

### DescriptionView
* Logo instead of image, smaller (business side)
* Add more info to the "description" tab so it looks less empty

### Functionality 
* Pulling data from every user
* Refactor main screens into a TabView

### Web App (Back-end)
* Business information needed to preload the web app with correct information
* Remove name of food truck dropdown, replace "Data Management" header with name of Food Truck

### Other stuff
* Optimization (app is very laggy as of right now)
* Analytics
* Refactor Code (Remove unused code, organize, etc.)
* * We need the business information for which food trucks we are working with so their data can be pre-loaded into the app
